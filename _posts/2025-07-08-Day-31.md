what_i_learned: |
  Today started with a brief check-in meeting with Dr. Oladunni. He asked us about our accomplishments so far and gave us guidance on what to do next. After the meeting, I focused on training my models and I am happy to say that I have successfully trained all three 
  models with at least 90% accuracy. That feels like a huge achievement for me and shows how far I have come in this project. I also added a line of code to save each trained model to my Google Drive. This makes sure that all my models are stored safely and I can access 
  them anytime without retraining. Later, I started working on fusing the unimodal models into one combined system. The fusion process is still running as I write this, and I am hopeful that by tomorrow, it will be completed successfully. Overall, it was a very 
  productive day and seeing these results gave me a lot of motivation.

blockers: |
  My only blocker today is that the fusion process is taking a long time to run. I need to wait for it to finish before checking if everything works correctly.

reflection: |
  Today felt like one of my most productive days so far. Training all three models with good accuracy made me feel proud of how much I have learned. Adding the code to save the models was also a good decision because it keeps my work safe. Even though the fusion is     
  taking long, I am patient because I know this is an important step towards completing the project. I am excited to see the final results soon.
