what_i_learned: |
  The team is gradually wrapping up all remaining tasks as we approach the final stretch of the program. On my part, I’ve continued refining our shared Google Colab notebook by adding extra code cells and comments to improve clarity and help everyone understand the workflow better. I also took time to compile all my results and progress into a well-organized Google Doc, which I’ve shared with the entire team. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to finalize their individual components and maintain consistency across the project. In addition, we've started having conversations about our final presentation. We’re discussing how best to showcase our contributions and make sure we’re confident and well-prepared when the time comes. There’s still work to be done, but overall, it feels like we’re aligning well and making strong progress together.

  The main challenge today was making sure everyone on the team is aligned and fully understands the updated Colab notebook. Even though I’ve added clarifying code cells and shared my compiled results, ensuring that all team members are on the same page takes time and back-and-forth communication. Also, with the final presentation approaching, there’s growing pressure to stay focused and manage time wisely.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a step in the right direction. It’s satisfying to see the project taking shape and everyone gradually wrapping up their parts. Sharing my compiled results gave me a sense of responsibility and support toward the team, and organizing the code helped me understand the flow of our project better. As we start planning for the final presentation, I feel more aware of what still needs to be done, but also proud of how far we’ve come.
