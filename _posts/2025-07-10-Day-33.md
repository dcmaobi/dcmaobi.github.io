what_i_learned: |
  Today went by pretty fast but was productive. We started the morning with a bootcamp session led by the Writing Center, where we learned better ways to write our research papers and improve our presentation skills. The session was very helpful because it gave me new tips on how to organize my writing clearly and present my work confidently. After lunch, we went back to our labs to continue working on our projects. In the lab, I spent time going over my accomplishments from yesterday with my graduate mentor, Sudip, to make sure I was on the right track. He gave me feedback and suggestions on how to improve my work and make it stronger. I have already started working on his suggestions to make sure my project meets its goals. Overall, today was filled with learning, reviewing, and making my work better.

blockers: |
   My main blocker today was making sure I understood all the feedback and how to apply it correctly. It took some time to figure out the best way to make the suggested changes.

reflection: |
   Today reminded me how important it is to always seek feedback and keep improving. The writing bootcamp helped me feel more prepared to write my papers and present my work professionally. Meeting with Sudip was also helpful because it showed me what I was doing right and what I needed to fix. I feel motivated to keep working hard and to finish this project strong.
