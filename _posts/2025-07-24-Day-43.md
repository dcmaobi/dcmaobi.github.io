what_i_learned: |
  Today wasn’t the most productive day for me. I spent a lot of time trying to implement the Explainable AI (XAI) part of the project, but it felt like I was stuck in a loop of errors. Just when I thought one issue was solved, another popped up. I expected XAI to be more straightforward, but I quickly realized I was missing key details that made it harder to understand and apply. Mentally, I’m exhausted. But even though today was tough, I’m still pushing forward. I know the final symposium is coming up, and I want to contribute something valuable to the team. I’ll keep learning, trying, and showing up until I get it right. Hoping tomorrow brings better results.

blockers: |
  Constant debugging errors while implementing XAI. Realizing I didn’t fully understand some parts of the XAI process. Feeling mentally drained from repeated setbacks.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that not every day will be smooth. Sometimes progress means simply not giving up. Even though I didn’t get the results I hoped for, I gained a better sense of what I still need to learn. I’ll take it slow, be patient with myself, and keep improving one step at a time.
