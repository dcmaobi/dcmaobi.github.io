what_i_learned: |
  Today, the team and I focused mainly on preparing for Thursday’s presentation. We worked together to finalize and complete the presentation slides, making sure each section clearly explains our project and progress so far. I also updated my experimental diagram, adding new details to show the current workflow and making it easier to explain during the presentation. Additionally, I spent time reviewing my script to ensure I am ready to present confidently. We practiced as a team to make sure everyone knows their part and that the presentation flows smoothly. Overall, it was a productive day of preparation and teamwork, getting us ready to showcase our work later this week.

blockers: |
  My main blocker today was getting myself ready for public speaking. Even though we finished the slides and practiced as a team, I still feel a bit nervous about presenting in front of everyone on Thursday. I want to build more confidence before the presentation day.

reflection: |
  Today was all about preparation and teamwork. Finalizing the presentation slides and updating my diagram made me feel organized and ready to share what we’ve been working on. Practicing with the team also helped us build confidence and understand each other’s parts better. Even though I’m still nervous about public speaking, I know that practicing more will help me feel more comfortable. I’m proud of how much we accomplished today and I feel more prepared for Thursday’s presentation.
