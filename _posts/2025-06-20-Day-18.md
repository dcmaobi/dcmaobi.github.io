what_i_learned: |
  Today went much better compared to the earlier days this week. Although we had to restart the training process for our AI model due to a few minor issues, the good news is that we now feel more confident that we’re on the right path. This restart gave us a chance to clean things up and make better decisions moving forward. I also worked closely with the programmer to update our experimental project diagram so it reflects our current stage in the workflow. The updated diagram now clearly shows the progress we’ve made and what stage we are at in the model development. We’re expecting to receive further guidance and next steps from Dr. Timothy soon, and this updated visual will help keep everyone on the same page as we move ahead.

   The main challenge today was having to restart the AI model training, which took a lot of time and slowed down our progress.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a turning point in the project. Even though we had to restart the model training, it gave us a chance to fix earlier mistakes and get back on track with more clarity. Working with the programmer to update the experimental diagram helped me better understand how each step connects and how far we've come. I feel more confident now, and I’m looking forward to the next steps from Dr. Timothy. Overall, it was a more productive and hopeful day than the rest of the week.
