what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued building on the literature review I started yesterday, diving deeper into related research to better understand the techniques used in similar ECG projects. As I read through these articles, I found myself actively brainstorming ways to improve upon the existing approaches—thinking critically about how our project could stand out or be more efficient than what’s been done before. This sparked new ideas and gave me a clearer sense of direction for the technical and presentation aspects of our work. On the practical side, I spent time organizing and labeling each block of code in our Google Colab notebook. This not only helped me understand the code better but also made it more accessible and easier for the rest of the team to follow. This cleanup is especially important as we prepare for the upcoming symposium video demo, where we’ll need to clearly explain how our system works from start to finish. Lastly, I took advantage of my 1-hour early dismissal reward—earned from one of the team games earlier this week. I chose to leave a bit early today because I was feeling mentally exhausted and knew I needed a break to recharge. Overall, the day was productive in both research and technical refinement, even with the early wrap-up.

   Aside from needing to leave early, there were no major blockers today.

reflection: |
   Today was a thoughtful and productive day. Diving deeper into the literature gave me a fresh perspective and sparked new ideas on how we can improve our project beyond what’s already been done. Labeling the code blocks also helped me feel more connected to the technical flow and made things clearer for both myself and the team, especially as we prepare for the symposium demo. Even though I needed to leave early to rest, I’m proud of the progress I made and how I balanced both research and practical work.
