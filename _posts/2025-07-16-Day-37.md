what_i_learned: |
  Today was quite packed—it honestly felt like I was going from one meeting to the next non-stop. The day started at 9:30 AM with a Zoom meeting with Dr. Oladunni, who mentioned that he would be checking in more frequently to track the project's progress. He gave feedback on what we had accomplished the previous day and also shared concerns about the absence of some team members. Later, we had our weekly check-in with our high school teacher, where we discussed challenges within the team and explored possible ways to handle them better. Not long after, my team was invited by the program management to address complaints they had received. We had a constructive conversation about possible solutions, one of which included a change of venue to improve our work dynamic. Despite the heavy schedule, I began incorporating the suggestions made by the professor into my work. I’m hoping to continue refining everything at home, and my goal is to have my program fully ready by tomorrow.

  My main challenge today wasn’t technical—it was the number of meetings and discussions we had. It made it hard to find focused, uninterrupted time to work deeply on my code. Also, some team dynamics are still a bit shaky, which adds mental stress.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important communication and teamwork are in a research environment. Even though I didn’t get as much coding done as I wanted, I still made progress by listening, adjusting, and planning for what’s next. I’m learning to manage interruptions and keep pushing forward even when the day doesn’t go as planned.
