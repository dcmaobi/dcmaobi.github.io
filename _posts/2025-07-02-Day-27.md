what_i_learned: |
  Today was fully focused on getting ready for tomorrow’s presentation. As a team, we finalized our preparation by populating and completing all the slides, making sure that each part clearly shows our progress and goals. Before break time, we had a Zoom meeting with Dr. Timothy, where he gave us helpful remarks and suggestions on how to improve the presentation flow and ensure that everything is explained clearly. After the meeting, we practiced our presentation multiple times. This helped us make corrections where needed and manage our time properly so we don’t exceed our slot tomorrow. Personally, I also spent some time calming my nerves and preparing myself mentally so I can deliver my part with confidence and clarity. Overall, it was a day of thorough preparation, teamwork, and building confidence for tomorrow’s big presentation.

blockers: |
  My only blocker today was myself. I’m not a big fan of presentations, and speaking in front of people makes me nervous. But even with that, I always aim to do my best and give the best performance I can.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important preparation is, especially for something like a presentation that makes me nervous. Finalizing the slides, getting feedback from Dr. Timothy, and practicing with the team helped me feel more ready. Even though I still feel anxious about speaking in front of others, I’m proud of how much effort I put in today to calm myself and prepare well. I know that as long as I keep trying, I will keep getting better at presenting with confidence.
