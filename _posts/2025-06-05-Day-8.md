what_i_learned: |
   We began the day with a two-hour campus tour. Although the sun was intense, the tour was informative and gave us a good look around. After that, we finalized the code for denoising the ECG images and moved on to the next step—applying a bandpass filter. If everything goes as planned, we should be wrapping up the entire process by tomorrow.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  Today was a mix of exploration and progress. The campus tour helped me feel more connected to the environment, even though the heat made it a bit tiring. Back in the lab, we successfully finalized our ECG denoising code, which felt like a big achievement. Moving on to the bandpass filtering step gave us a clearer sense of how the project is coming together. I’m starting to see how each part builds on the last, and I’m feeling more confident about finishing the process tomorrow.
