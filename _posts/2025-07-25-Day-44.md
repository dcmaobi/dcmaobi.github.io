what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about regrouping and refocusing. After running into multiple errors while trying to implement the Explainable AI (XAI) part of my project, I decided it was time to talk things through with the professor. We had a productive conversation, and I expressed my concern that chasing perfection at this stage might take away from preparing for the upcoming presentation. Thankfully, we’re now aligned on a new plan: keep it simple and focus on getting a basic version of XAI working—just enough to demonstrate the concept clearly. This shift in approach helped ease some of the pressure and gave me a clearer direction. With that in mind, I’ve started working on my demo for Thursday’s symposium. I want it to be smooth, informative, and a strong reflection of the work I’ve done. The pressure is definitely building as the end of the program nears, but I’m staying focused and doing my best to wrap things up meaningfully

blockers: |
  Faced recurring technical errors while implementing Explainable AI (XAI), which slowed progress. Mental exhaustion from trying to perfect the model late in the timeline. Growing pressure from the upcoming symposium presentation made it difficult to juggle both perfection and preparedness.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that sometimes done is better than perfect—especially when deadlines are close. Communicating with the professor helped me reset my priorities and focus on what really matters: delivering a clear, working demo. Even though I’m feeling the pressure, shifting my mindset to completion over perfection gave me new energy to move forward with purpose.
