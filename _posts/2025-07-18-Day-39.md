what_i_learned: |
  Today, I made important progress on my part of the project. I was able to implement late fusion using the 1D-CNN and Transformer models. This means I successfully extracted features from both models and combined them into a shared network to make better predictions. It took a lot of setup — making sure the feature shapes matched, building the fusion layer, and adjusting the architecture so the model could be trained properly. I also organized the training code to allow better monitoring of the accuracy and loss over each epoch, which will help when I begin to evaluate and compare performance. Although it’s not perfect yet, getting the fusion code to run without errors was a big step forward. I now have a working version of the late fusion pipeline, and that’s something I’m proud of.

  I’ve been going back and forth between fixing errors, debugging, and re-running the code. It’s been frustrating and tiring, but I’m trying to stay focused. The model takes time to train, and each mistake costs a lot of time to correct.

reflection: |
  Even though it’s tough, I’ve learned a lot by doing the late fusion step myself. I understand more now about how to merge features and how small issues in the code can affect everything. I just hope all the work pays off soon.
