what_i_learned: |
   Today, we had a check-in meeting with our faculty mentor to review the progress we made on last week’s assigned tasks. During the session, we made necessary corrections based on his feedback and discussed the steps needed to move the project forward. He stressed the importance of picking up the pace so we can meet our goals on time. For my part, he requested that I add more detail to the sketch I created for our experimental design. He clarified what he expected to see, which helped me understand how to present the stages of our project more clearly. I’ve already started making the changes he suggested and now feel more confident about how to structure and communicate our workflow visually.

   Today’s meeting with our mentor was a reminder of how important clarity and precision are in research. Getting direct feedback helped me see exactly where I needed to improve, especially with the experimental design sketch. It felt good to gain a better understanding of what’s expected and to begin making those adjustments right away. I’m learning that being open to corrections and adapting quickly is a key part of working on a team and moving the project forward.
