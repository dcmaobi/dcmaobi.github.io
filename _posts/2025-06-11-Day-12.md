what_i_learned: |
   I learned that our original ECG datasets were giving wrong results because they were images instead of actual numerical data. So, the team decided to find new datasets online that had real ECG values. We found one with about 87,000 files, which took a long time to download, unzip, and run through our code. To make things faster and avoid crashes, we came up with a new plan: we reduced the amount of data going into the Python code at a time. This helped us move forward more smoothly.

  The file processing was time consuming.

  Today was a mix of challenge and problem-solving. We realized that the ECG image data we started with wasn’t giving us the right results, so we had to switch to a new dataset with real numerical values. Downloading and handling over 87,000 files was a bit overwhelming, and running it all at once slowed things down. But as a team, we found a smarter way—by limiting how much data we fed into the code at a time. It felt good to work through the issue together and find a solution that worked.
