what_i_learned: |
   Today began on a fun and relaxing note as we spent the first few hours playing group games like Taboo and Jenga, which helped us bond and take a break from the usual workload. After that, we had an Overleaf bootcamp, where I learned how to use LaTeX to write and organize research documents more effectively. Later in the day, I continued learning about ECG signal processing, focusing on how to clean and analyze signals using time and frequency domain techniques. I practiced using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to detect heartbeat peaks and explore signal frequencies with FFT. I also began learning about feature extraction, an important step that helps us pull out useful patterns from the cleaned ECG signals for future classification. Overall, it was a productive day full of fun, learning, and progress.

  Today was a good balance of fun and learning. Starting the day with games like Taboo and Jenga helped me relax and connect more with the group. The Overleaf bootcamp was also helpful—I now feel more confident using LaTeX for our research work. I made solid progress in understanding signal processing and took things a step further by learning about feature extraction. It's exciting to see how the pieces are coming together and how each part of the project is building on what we’ve already done.
