what_i_learned: |
   Today, we wrapped up the writing bootcamp, which gave me great insights on how to improve my presentation delivery and structure my final report. After that, I returned to the lab to continue with my project work. Specifically, I focused on refining the intermediate fusion stage of our AI model. This involved reviewing the outputs from the individual 1D-CNN, Transformer, and 2D-CNN models to make sure the features extracted from each were correctly aligned for fusion. I also began organizing the fused features into a format suitable for training the final classification model. It was a bit challenging, but I made good progress getting the data pipeline and code ready for the next training run.

   The pressure of the program’s deadline really started to show today. As a team, we were feeling overwhelmed, and it led to a tense environment. It was difficult to maintain focus at times, and I didn’t get to complete all the coding I had planned. I’ll be taking my laptop home to finish up and ensure everything is ready for testing tomorrow.

reflection: |
   Despite the stress and time crunch, I’m proud of how much I’ve learned and accomplished. Tackling the intermediate fusion section has helped me understand how complex yet powerful multimodal learning can be. I’ve also learned that setbacks are part of the process, and what matters most is staying committed to the goal—even if that means working late or reviewing the same code several times.
