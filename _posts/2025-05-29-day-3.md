what_i_learned: |
   We kicked off the day with a bootcamp on Computer Vision, followed by a fun Escape Room game within our project teams to strengthen communication. We also continued our Python 101 session from yesterday, building on the basics we had learned.

reflection: |
 Today was both engaging and challenging. The Computer Vision bootcamp introduced exciting new concepts, and continuing with Python helped reinforce my understanding. The Escape Room activity was a highlight—it pushed us to communicate better and think as a team. I’m starting to see how all the pieces are coming together, and it’s motivating.
