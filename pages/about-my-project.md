project_title: "EcgNet: A Hybrid Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Diagnosis"

problem: |
  Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. However, analyzing ECG (electrocardiogram) signals manually can be time-consuming, error-prone, and requires specialized expertise — especially in low-resource or fast-paced clinical settings. Traditional diagnostic systems may miss subtle patterns or struggle with noisy signals, limiting their accuracy and reliability. 
  
  This project aims to solve these issues by developing a deep learning model that can automatically analyze ECG data, reduce noise, detect abnormalities, and support medical decision-making with greater speed, accuracy, and transparency.

approach: |
  This project uses a deep learning model called EcgNet to help detect heart problems from ECG signals. It combines two types of AI—CNN (for finding patterns) and LSTM (for tracking changes over time). Before the model looks at the data, filters are used to clean up any noise in the ECG signals. The system can also use extra info like patient age or history to improve results. Tools like SHAP or LIME help explain how the model makes decisions, so doctors can understand and trust what it says.
  
outcome: |
  The expected outcome of this project is a working AI system that can accurately detect heart problems from ECG signals. The model should be able to handle noisy data, make quick and reliable predictions, and explain its decisions clearly. This tool can help doctors make better choices, especially in places where expert help is limited. In the long term, it could support faster diagnoses, fewer errors, and better patient care.
