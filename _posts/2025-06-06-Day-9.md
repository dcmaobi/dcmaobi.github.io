what_i_learned: |
   We began the day by finalizing and reviewing the bandpass filter. After that, we tested our current model to ensure everything was working properly in preparation for next week's steps. To wrap up the week, we created a report summarizing our progress in the form of a PowerPoint presentation video.

  The main challenge today was the video presentation — it didn’t go as smoothly as we hoped, but it’s something we can definitely improve on.

reflection: |
  Today started off strong as we finalized and reviewed the bandpass filter and tested our model to make sure everything was working well for the next phase of the project. It felt good to see how far we’ve come over the week. However, the day ended a bit stressfully. While recording our group video presentation, there were moments of confusion and misunderstanding that made the process more difficult than expected. Even though it was challenging, it reminded me how important clear communication and teamwork are in group projects.
