what_i_learned: |
   We got to know each other better as a team through collaborative activities, and at the same time, we were introduced to Git and GitHub — tools used for version control in software development. We learned how to use Git to track changes in our code and how to use GitHub to share our projects, collaborate online, and manage contributions from different team members efficiently.

  No blockers!

reflection: |
  This project helped us grow as a team and learn the basics of Git and GitHub. It showed us how useful version control is for working together on code.
