what_i_learned: |
   Today, we began working on the project by writing Python code to help clean up ECG images. We also spent time getting more familiar with using Google Colab, and we set up Slack to make our group communication more organized.
blockers: |
   Understanding every code we wrote to be able to communicate it, but I will get there.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive start to our project. I got hands-on experience writing Python code to denoise ECG images, which helped me understand both the data and the tools better. Getting used to Google Colab and setting up Slack also made our team feel more connected and ready to collaborate efficiently. I'm looking forward to making more progress tomorrow.
