  Today was both engaging and productive. I started with a meeting with Dr. Oladunni, who proposed a shift in our project plan to accelerate progress. He added new tasks to be completed by Friday, which meant I had to pick up the pace — especially after yesterday’s slower day. One major milestone was implementing Intermediate Fusion into the model, which I successfully completed today. Earlier in the day, we attended a 2-hour group session at the Business Building that began with a fun bingo icebreaker. The workshop focused on how our different learning styles and personality types can influence our work — both positively and negatively. We explored ways to use these traits to our advantage in group dynamics. We ended with a gallery walk activity where we pitched our project and personal insights to others, which helped build communication and presentation confidence.

  The main challenge today was adjusting to the sudden addition of new tasks and managing time efficiently to complete the Intermediate Fusion step within the same day.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how quickly things can change in a research project. It was a push, but I’m proud I was able to rise to the challenge. The interactive session also gave me a better understanding of how to work more effectively with my team by respecting different personalities and learning approaches. It was a balance of teamwork, learning, and execution.
