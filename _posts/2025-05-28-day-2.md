what_i_learned: |
  We met our faculty and graduate mentors, introduced ourselves, and discussed the project we’re about to begin. We also got an introduction to the Python programming language. To unwind after the long day, we played Headbands as a fun way to relax and connect.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a great mix of learning and bonding. Meeting our mentors and diving into the project gave me a clear sense of direction, and getting introduced to Python sparked my curiosity. Ending the day with a fun game helped ease the stress and brought everyone closer. I'm excited for what's ahead.
