what_i_learned: |
   Today, I made solid progress on the technical side of our project. I continued working with Python tools like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to clean and analyze ECG signals. I improved my understanding of signal processing by learning how to detect heartbeat peaks and calculate heart rate in the time domain, and how to use FFT to explore signal patterns in the frequency domain. I also began learning about feature extraction, which involves pulling out important patterns from the ECG data to prepare it for the next stage—classification using deep learning. In addition, I created the PowerPoint slides that our team used for the weekly report, helping us communicate our progress clearly and effectively.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a step forward in both my learning and contribution to the project. I was able to understand more about how ECG signals are processed, especially how we extract useful information from them using Python. Starting feature extraction gave me a clearer picture of how our data will eventually be used in machine learning. I also helped the team by putting together the PowerPoint slides for our weekly report, which made me feel more involved in the communication side of our work. Overall, it was a productive and rewarding day.
