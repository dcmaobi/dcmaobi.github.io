what_i_learned: |
   Today, I took the initiative to redesign our experimental diagram from scratch. After reflecting on the structure and receiving feedback, I realized I had a much clearer idea of how I wanted the diagram to represent our project. The new design aims to map out each stage of the workflow in a more organized and visually intuitive way. I’m working closely with the programmer to ensure that every step we take in the project is accurately captured in the diagram. This will serve as a helpful guide for both the team and anyone trying to understand our approach. So far, the diagram has been updated to reflect all the work we’ve completed, and I’ll continue revising it as the project progresses.

   Redesigning the experimental diagram today helped me realize how important clear visuals are in communicating complex ideas. Starting from scratch gave me the chance to better organize the flow of our project and make it easier for others to understand. Working alongside the programmer also showed me how collaboration can lead to stronger results. I’m proud of the progress so far and motivated to keep updating the diagram as we move forward.
