  bio: |
    I’m currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at The Community College of Baltimore County, Maryland. I expect to graduate by Fall 2025.

    I’m working on a project called EcgNet. It uses a type of artificial intelligence to help doctors find heart problems by looking at ECG signals (the electrical signals from the heart). The system combines smart tools to understand patterns in the data, clean up the noise, and give clear results. The goal is to make heart disease diagnosis faster, more accurate, and easier to explain to doctors and patients.

    When I’m not working on research or studying, I enjoy exploring new income streams, gaming on my console , and working on some personal projects in my free time.
