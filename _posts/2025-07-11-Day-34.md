what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on implementing the changes suggested by my mentor to improve my project. I worked on creating the graph representation of my 1D-CNN Transformer training results to clearly show how the model is performing. This will help make my presentations and reports more visual and easier to understand. I also tried to redo the whole process using a new set of data to test if the model works well with different inputs. However, I couldn’t find any suitable new dataset today, but I plan to continue searching or seek help next week. As requested by Dr. Timothy Oladunni, I sent him the results from my model training for his review and feedback. His clarification will guide my next steps and ensure I’m on the right track. Lastly, I spent some time trying to understand the analysis of Intermediate Fusion for my project. It is still a bit confusing right now, but I hope by Monday, after meeting with our faculty mentor, I will have a better understanding and be able to move forward confidently.

blockers: |
  My main blocker today was not finding a new suitable dataset to test the model and struggling to fully understand the Intermediate Fusion analysis.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that progress is not always about finishing everything quickly but about taking time to understand and improve each part. Even though I couldn’t find a new dataset and Intermediate Fusion was confusing, I still made progress by improving my graphs and sending in my results for review. I believe that with guidance next week, I will gain more clarity and continue moving forward confidently.
