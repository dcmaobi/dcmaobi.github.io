what_i_learned: |
  Today, I shifted focus slightly toward conducting a literature review to better understand existing methods and techniques related to our project. This helped me gain more context and informed my next steps as I moved into reviewing and analyzing our current code. I took time to carefully study how different parts of the code worked and made a few updates to see if those changes could improve the model’s performance. Encouragingly, we saw a noticeable improvement in the accuracy of the numerical dataset, which was a big step forward. While working through the code, I also updated the experimental diagram to accurately reflect each process and step being taken in our workflow. This not only helped me deepen my understanding but also ensured that the visual representation of our project stays aligned with our actual progress.

blockers: |
  My main blocker today was having to re-run the code multiple times, which made progress feel slow and time-consuming.

reflection: |
  Today required a lot of patience, especially with the repeated code runs that slowed things down. Still, taking time to dive into the literature and understand the code better gave me a stronger grasp of the project. Seeing improvement in the numerical dataset accuracy was encouraging and reminded me that small steps still count as progress. Updating the experimental diagram along the way also helped me stay organized and clear on the workflow. Despite the slow pace, I feel more grounded and better prepared to keep pushing forward.
