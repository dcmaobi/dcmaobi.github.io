what_i_learned: |
  Today, since I had finished my part of the project, I helped with other areas. I focused on learning more about the signal processing stage in ECG analysis. I learned how to get useful information from cleaned ECG signals using two main methods: time-domain and frequency-domain. In the time domain, I learned how to find heartbeat peaks and calculate heart rate. In the frequency domain, I used something called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to look at the signal’s frequency and spot main patterns. I also got some hands-on practice using Python tools like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to do and show these steps. This helped me understand how signal processing prepares the ECG data for the next step in our project, where we’ll use deep learning models like ResNet-18 for classification.

  I hard a hard time getting to understand the Python code.

  Today was a learning-filled day. Since I had finished my main task, I took the chance to support the team and learn more about signal processing. I explored how to work with ECG signals by finding heartbeat peaks and using FFT to study the signal’s frequency. It was my first time really using tools like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib in this way, and it helped me understand how important this step is before we move to the deep learning part. I feel more connected to the project now and excited to keep learning.
