  Today marked the first official in-person kickoff of the program, and it was a great start. We began by gathering in the auditorium, where we finally got to put faces to the names we’ve been seeing online. It was a warm and welcoming environment that helped set the tone for the rest of the day. Next, we were formally introduced to the field of AI research. We learned about what AI research involves, its goals, and how it connects to real-world problems. This gave us a better understanding of the exciting work we’re about to do. We also took group photos to capture the moment and celebrate the start of the journey. Afterward, we broke into small groups for a quick team-building activity called “The Tallest Marshmallow,” where we had to build the tallest structure possible using marshmallows and sticks. It was a fun and creative way to get to know our teammates and practice collaboration. Finally, we went to our assigned labs to begin our projects. In our lab, we were introduced to the research topic we’ll be working on and got a clear explanation of what is expected by the end of the week. It was a packed day, but a very exciting and motivating start to the program.

  The program officially began today, and it was great to finally meet everyone in person. We kicked things off in the auditorium, where we were introduced to the world of AI research and what it involves. One of the highlights was the “tallest marshmallow” challenge — a fun way to break the ice and work as a team. Later, we headed to our labs, where we got an overview of our project and what’s expected by the end of the week. It was a full day, but it set a strong foundation for what’s ahead.
