what_i_learned: |
  Today, I made significant progress on the ECG analysis project by refining the denoising pipeline to efficiently process entire folders of ECG images. I updated the Python script to accept a zipped folder, automatically apply preprocessing steps such as Gaussian blur and adaptive thresholding to each image, and save the cleaned outputs into a new zip file for easy download. Additionally, our team had a productive meeting with our faculty mentor, who provided important clarifications and suggested key adjustments to our methodology. These improvements helped us fine-tune our workflow and better align our preprocessing steps with the goals of the AI model training phase.

  The only challenge today was dealing with the hot weather, which made it a bit harder to focus.

reflection: |
  Today was a big step forward in both my technical work and understanding of the project. Refining the denoising pipeline to handle whole folders of ECG images made the process more efficient and practical for real use. Updating the Python script to automatically clean each image and export the results in a downloadable zip file felt like a clear improvement. Our meeting with the faculty mentor also helped a lot—his feedback clarified some of the doubts we had and helped us adjust our approach. Overall, the day left me feeling more confident that we’re moving in the right direction and that our work is becoming more organized and aligned with the model’s needs.---
