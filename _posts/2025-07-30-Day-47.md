what_i_learned: |
  Today marked a major turning point—it was not only our final day focused on the research portion of the program but also a full-on prep day for tomorrow’s big presentation. The energy in the room felt different—equal parts focused and reflective. Most of our time was spent putting finishing touches on the code, slides, and experimental diagrams. I personally finalized both the code and diagram updates earlier, so my main focus shifted toward polishing the presentation slides and ensuring the message we deliver is as clear as the work we’ve done. Knowing this was our last full research day made everything feel more meaningful. It reminded me of how far we’ve come—from figuring out our methodology, training our models, making improvements, solving tough bugs, to now confidently preparing to share it all with others. There's a quiet excitement in the air, mixed with some nerves, but it feels good to be at this stage.

blockers: |
  The biggest blocker today wasn’t technical—it was time pressure. With the presentation around the corner and today being the last research-focused day, there was a real sense of urgency to tie everything together. Balancing the final touches with preparation created a tight timeline that required careful coordination.

reflection: |
  Looking back, it’s impressive how much progress has been made. From learning new tools and concepts to debugging difficult errors and making sense of complex data, it’s all come together. Today especially reminded me that research isn't just about getting things to work—it's also about communicating that work clearly. Shifting from "building" to "presenting" helped me see how valuable the journey has been. Now it's all about sharing it with confidence.
