what_i_learned: |
   Today was a big step forward in our project. We started by discussing the best way to denoise ECG images. At first, we were a bit unsure of what steps to take, especially before starting the actual denoising. Luckily, after speaking with our faculty professor, things became clearer. He helped us understand the importance of preparing and processing the ECG data correctly before applying any techniques. We also spent time researching past publications and projects that tackled similar problems. Reading about different approaches—like wavelet transforms and filtering methods—helped us decide which direction might work best for us. As an update from yesterday, I’m also happy to say that the Python code, which I had been struggling with, is finally starting to make more sense. Working with the actual data and writing code for real tasks is helping everything click into place. I’m feeling more confident and excited to keep building on what I’ve learned.

   I struggled a bit with finding research articles that specifically focused on denoising ECG images. Many of the papers I came across were either too broad, focusing on general ECG analysis, or too technical, making it hard to understand how the methods could be applied to our project. It took time and patience to refine my search terms and filter through the information to find resources that were truly relevant and helpful for our specific goal.

  Today had its challenges, but it was also full of learning. One of the main tasks was researching how to denoise ECG images. I found it difficult at first to locate articles that directly addressed this topic—many were either too general or too technical. But after refining my search and digging deeper, I started to find more useful resources. We also got valuable guidance from our faculty professor, which helped clarify the steps we need to take. On a positive note, the Python code is finally starting to make more sense to me. It feels good to see real progress in both understanding and applying what we’ve learned so far.
