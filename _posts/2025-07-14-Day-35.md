what_i_learned: |
  Today was relatively calm because I’ve reached the point where I need a review and feedback from my Faculty Mentor to know what to improve or complete next. So far, I believe I’ve finished a large part of the project, including training multiple models, successfully fusing them, and starting the Explainable AI (XAI) phase. Yesterday, I focused on understanding the XAI section better. I reviewed two types of XAI methods and how they can help explain the decisions made by our AI model. This helped me prepare for deeper discussions with my mentor and gave me more confidence moving forward. Today was mostly about reviewing everything I’ve done and preparing for tomorrow’s mentor meeting, where I expect to get direction for the final steps.

blockers: |
  My only blocker today was needing feedback before I can move forward. Without it, I wasn’t sure what next step to take or what to adjust.

reflection: |
  Sometimes, waiting is part of progress. Even though today was slower, I realized that pausing to reflect and seek feedback is just as important as doing the hands-on work. I feel proud of how far I’ve come and prepared for whatever next steps are recommended. I’ve done the work — now it’s time to polish and present it right.
