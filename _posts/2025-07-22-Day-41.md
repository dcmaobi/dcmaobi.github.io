  Today was a meaningful day in many ways. Dr. Timothy Oladunni visited our lab and took time to check on how far we’ve come. He gave some helpful feedback and praised the progress we’ve made. With just a few days left in the program, the pressure is real — everyone is working hard to finish strong. Personally, I’m doing my best to stay focused and not let the stress get to me. One big task we can now check off is the commercial video — my team finished it today, which means I can now focus fully on finalizing my own part of the project. I’m preparing for the last round of work: improving model performance, applying XAI, and practicing for the final pitch. But the highlight of my day was when Dr. Timothy shared something exciting — he offered me a spot in his research lab when I transfer to Morgan State University. It’s a big deal, and although I haven’t fully processed it yet, I’m very grateful. The opportunity reminds me how much growth I’ve experienced during this program. I’m hoping to finish everything on a strong note, keep pushing through the final tasks, and make the most of what’s left in this amazing journey.

  The biggest challenge today is staying focused under pressure. With so much to finish and limited time, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed — but I’m pushing through.

  Today reminded me how far I’ve come. Even with the pressure of the program’s end, I feel proud of my progress and how I’m managing my responsibilities. Finishing the video was a big win, and receiving an offer to join Dr. Timothy’s lab was the encouragement I didn’t even know I needed. I’m trying not to overthink — just take it one step at a time, focus on my final goals, and finish strong.
