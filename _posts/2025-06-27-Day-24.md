what_i_learned: |
  Today, I began exploring a new approach to improve the model’s accuracy on the ECG image datasets, based on a suggestion from our graduate mentor, Sudip. He advised me to create a fresh Google Colab notebook separate from the one the team has been using. The idea was to start from scratch and try different techniques—this way, we could either confirm our current process or discover better alternatives. I began implementing this new pipeline and made it up to the signal processing stage. While working through it, I noticed something that might have been done incorrectly in our previous implementation. Although I’m still in the process of verifying it, this discovery could explain part of the model’s low accuracy. If confirmed, I’ll need to revise and update our experimental diagram to reflect the corrected steps. Additionally, we decided to include Ms. Heather in our weekly video presentation. It was nice bringing her into the process, and we made sure she was updated and involved in showcasing our team’s progress. Overall, today was all about experimentation, careful observation, and moving one step closer to a more accurate and reliable model.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how important it is to keep an open mind and be willing to try new approaches. Starting from scratch with a new Colab notebook gave me the chance to really think through each step and question parts of our original process. Even though I haven’t confirmed my discovery yet, noticing a possible mistake shows how much more aware and confident I’ve become in the technical work. It also felt good to include Ms. Heather in our weekly presentation—it made the project feel more connected and team-driven. Overall, I feel like today moved us in a better direction, both technically and collaboratively.
