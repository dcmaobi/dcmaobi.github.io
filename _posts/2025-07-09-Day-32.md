what_i_learned: |
  Today, I completed the fusion of the three models, which was a big step forward in the project. Along the way, I got a bit lost in the process, but I know I can retrace my steps and fix any mistakes to keep everything working smoothly. I also started working on XAI, which stands for Explainable Artificial Intelligence. I will be trying out two different types of XAI methods to decide which one is best for explaining the results from my models. This will help make our AI work clearer and easier to understand. As a team, we took some time for team bonding activities, which was suggested by our high school teacher. It was fun and helped us relieve stress while building stronger relationships within the team. Right now, my code is still running, but I believe that by tomorrow, I will be able to check the results and update my experimental diagram to reflect the new progress. Overall, today was productive and I feel good about the work I accomplished.

blockers: |
  My main blocker today was getting lost during the model fusion process, which slowed me down for a while. I also need to wait for the current code to finish running before checking the results.

reflection: |
  Today showed me that even when I feel stuck, I can always go back and retrace my steps to find a solution. Completing the model fusion felt like a big achievement, and starting on XAI opened my mind to how important it is to make AI understandable. The team bonding activity was also a good reminder that taking breaks and having fun together is part of building a strong team. I am looking forward to seeing my code results tomorrow and continuing with the XAI work
