what_i_learned: |
   Today marked the official start of our project work, and we focused on writing Python code to clean up (denoise) ECG images. This involved learning how to apply signal processing techniques to reduce noise and make the ECG signals easier to interpret. At first, it was a bit overwhelming, but breaking the task into smaller steps helped us manage it better. We also spent time getting more familiar with Google Colab, since it's the main tool we’re using to write and run our code in the cloud. It was a learning experience for some of us who were new to it, but we’re getting more comfortable navigating its features and collaborating in real-time. To improve our workflow and stay organized, we set up a Slack workspace for the team. This gave us a more efficient way to communicate, share files, and track progress outside of meetings. Altogether, it was a productive day of learning, setting up, and taking the first steps into the technical side of our research.

   Understanding every code we wrote to be able to communicate it, but I will get there.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive start to our project. I got hands-on experience writing Python code to denoise ECG images, which helped me understand both the data and the tools better. Getting used to Google Colab and setting up Slack also made our team feel more connected and ready to collaborate efficiently. I'm looking forward to making more progress tomorrow.
