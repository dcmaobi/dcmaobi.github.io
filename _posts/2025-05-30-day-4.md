what_i_learned: |
  We began the day by wrapping up our Python 101 course. After that, we played a series of quiz games on Kahoot, which made learning fun and interactive. We also explored the basics of Generative AI and its key concepts. Later, we examined a set of images to determine whether they were AI-generated and discussed ways to verify the authenticity of AI-generated content.

  The hardest part for me was taking in so much new information about Generative AI all at once

reflection: |
  Today was fun and full of learning. We finished the Python 101 course, and I felt proud of how far I’ve come. The Kahoot games helped me remember what I learned. Learning about Generative AI was interesting but also a bit hard because there was a lot of new information. I enjoyed the part where we checked if pictures were made by AI and talked about how to tell if something is real or fake. I’m happy with what I’ve learned and excited to keep learning more.
