   Today, our weekly cohort meeting was held a day earlier due to the upcoming Juneteenth holiday. During the session, Dr. Naja addressed some important concerns and emphasized the value of professionalism in both our work and communication. As part of a team-building activity, we played a ranking game that helped strengthen our collaboration and decision-making skills. We also welcomed high school teachers who will be joining the project, and we introduced our work to them in a fun, engaging way. Afterward, we spent time getting to know one of the teachers better and explained our project in more detail, helping her get up to speed on our goals and progress. On the technical side, our team is still working on improving the AI model's performance. Currently, we’re seeing about 30% accuracy on the image datasets and 14% on the numeric datasets. Our aim is to reach at least 90% accuracy, and we’re hopeful that we’ll make significant progress by the end of the week.

   My main challenge right now is how slowly the model is progressing. I can’t help but feel a bit anxious about whether we’ll be able to achieve the results we need for the project to be successful.

    Today was a mix of team-building, mentorship, and technical challenges. Meeting early due to the Juneteenth holiday gave us a chance to reflect on our progress and hear important reminders from Dr. Naja about professionalism. Playing the ranking game was a fun way to strengthen teamwork and think critically together. Introducing our project to the high school teachers helped me see our work from a fresh perspective, and explaining it clearly made me more confident in what we’ve accomplished so far. Although we're still struggling with low accuracy in training our AI model, I’m staying hopeful and motivated to push forward and improve our results.
