what_i_learned: |
   We got to know each other better as a team through collaborative activities, and at the same time, we were introduced to Git and GitHub — tools used for version control in software development. We learned how to use Git to track changes in our code and how to use GitHub to share our projects, collaborate online, and manage contributions from different team members efficiently. We also got tested to determine our level in Python programming language.

blockers: |
  No blockers!

reflection: |
  The placement test and team activities helped us connect and work better together. We also learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control, making it easier to manage and share our code as a team.
