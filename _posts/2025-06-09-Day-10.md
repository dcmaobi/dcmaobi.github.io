   We began the day with a meeting with Dr. Timothy Oladunni, where he shared his expectations for the project and emphasized the need to move quickly toward both completion and publication. To help speed things up, he divided the tasks among the team. As a result, we’re now working on both the coding and the publication side of the project in parallel. I was assigned to design diagrams that visually explain the different stages of our work. I’ve completed the initial drafts, which will serve as a foundation and can be updated as the project evolves. With that part done for now, I’m shifting my focus back to assisting with the coding tasks.

  No blockers!

  Today pushed us to pick up the pace and take on more responsibility. Meeting with Dr. Oladunni gave us a clearer picture of how ambitious the timeline is for both completing the project and preparing it for publication. With the tasks now divided, it feels like we’re really stepping into a more professional workflow. Designing the diagrams helped me better understand the flow of our work, and now that they’re done for the moment, I’m ready to dive back into the coding side. It’s a bit of pressure, but also exciting to be part of something moving this fast.
