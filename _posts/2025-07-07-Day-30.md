what_i_learned: |
  Today, I made very good progress on the project. With the help of Dr. Oladunni, I successfully trained the 1D-CNN model, which was a big step forward. I also thought I had trained the other models correctly, but after checking my work, I realized there was a misunderstanding in the features extracted for the second model. I am currently working on fixing this issue to make sure the model is trained properly. Hopefully, by tomorrow, I will be ready to start merging all three models to move the project to the next stage. Overall, it felt good to see my efforts coming together today.

blockers: |
  My main blocker today was the misunderstanding in the features extracted for the second model. It slowed me down a bit because I had to go back and figure out what went wrong before continuing.

reflection: |
  Today showed me how important it is to double-check my work at each step. Even though I faced a challenge with the second model’s features, I am proud of myself for catching the mistake early and working to fix it. Training the 1D-CNN model successfully gave me more confidence, and I am feeling motivated to continue tomorrow and start merging the models. Each small success is bringing me closer to finishing this project strong.
