what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on tightening the link between prediction and explainability in my ECG classification project. I made the code more functional by turning blocks into reusable functions and added a prediction cell before the XAI output for better clarity. I noticed Grad-CAM wasn’t aligning with the predicted class, which made me question whether preprocessing like cropping or denoising was being unintentionally reapplied. To address this, I adjusted the image pipeline to isolate and save cropped images as a new dataset. I also worked on fusing the XAI outputs—showing the original image, Grad-CAM, and LIME together based on the same prediction. This helped ensure explanations actually matched what the model predicted. Finally, I updated my methodology to reflect the real workflow. Today was about more than fixing bugs—it was about aligning code, visuals, and documentation to tell one clear, accurate story.

blockers: |
  One major blocker today was the mismatch between the model’s prediction and the XAI explanations. Grad-CAM was explaining a different class than the model predicted, which made interpretation confusing. There was also uncertainty around whether preprocessing steps like cropping and denoising were unintentionally being reapplied during Grad-CAM visualization. Debugging the flow between prediction and XAI output was mentally exhausting and time-consuming, especially under time pressure.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that even when a model “works,” the clarity of its explanation is equally important—especially in biomedical projects. Catching mismatches between predictions and visual explanations helped me focus on making sure everything is logically aligned. I learned the importance of not just getting the code to run, but also making sure the visual outputs tell the right story. Though today had its frustrations, it felt rewarding to catch these critical issues before the final demo.
