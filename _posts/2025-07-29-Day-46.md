what_i_learned: |
  Today, the team focused on putting the final touches on everything in preparation for Thursday’s big event. We’ve been working hard to ensure that all tasks are completed today so that tomorrow can be fully dedicated to practicing our presentation without any distractions. On my end, I finalized updates to both the main code and the experimental diagram, ensuring everything is in sync and ready for demonstration. With those parts now complete, I’ve shifted my attention to helping finalize our presentation slides—making sure they clearly explain our workflow, results, and key takeaways. At this point, the goal is to refine our delivery and aim for a strong, confident performance on Thursday.

  The main challenge today was balancing the pressure of final preparations with the need to stay calm and focused. With the event approaching, it was a bit stressful ensuring all technical and visual elements were fully aligned and presentation-ready.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a final sprint. Seeing the project come together—from code to visuals—was satisfying, but it also reminded me how important it is to stay organized under pressure. Completing the experimental diagram and code gave me a sense of accomplishment, and now, turning that work into a clear and confident presentation is the final goal. I’ve learned that strong preparation now can make all the difference on presentation day.
