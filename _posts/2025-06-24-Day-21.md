what_i_learned: |
  Today, I started with a team meeting led by Dr. Naja Mack, where she shared important updates about pending payment checks, Friday’s presentation expectations, and attendance matters. After that, my team met with Ms. Heather, the high school teacher working with us, to clarify our individual roles and what each of us plans to present on Friday. She also encouraged us to engage in more team bonding activities. Later, I spent time reviewing our Google Colab code, using it as a reference to update my experimental diagram. This also helped me better understand what each part of the code is doing, giving me more confidence in explaining our workflow.

blockers: |
   There were no major blockers today, except that the model’s validation accuracy is still lower than we hoped.

reflection: |
    Today gave me a better sense of direction and clarity as we prepare for Friday’s presentation. Hearing updates from Dr. Naja helped me understand what’s expected, while the meeting with Ms. Heather pushed me to reflect on my individual contributions and how best to communicate them. Reviewing the Colab code helped me connect each part of the workflow to our overall project goals. I’m starting to feel more confident in my understanding and more prepared to present my work clearly to others.
