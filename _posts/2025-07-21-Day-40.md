what_i_learned: |
  We started the day with a meeting at the auditorium where we got training on Overleaf, talked about how to prepare our final paper, and learned tips for the elevator pitch. They also shared how the last day of the program will go. It reminded me that the end is close, and while I’m excited, it’s also a bit stressful. For my project, I believe I have finished the late fusion part for all three models — the 1D-CNN, Transformer, and 2D-CNN. That’s a big step forward. But while working, I came up with a new idea I want to try when I get home. I think it could help improve the model even more. After that, I’ll move on to the XAI (Explainable AI) part and start getting ready for my elevator pitch.

blockers: |
  No major blockers during the day, but I feel the pressure of time. I want to finish everything and still do it well.

reflection: |
  Today showed how far I’ve come in the program. From working on code to learning how to talk about my project, I’ve grown in many ways. Even though there’s still work to do, I feel more confident and excited to show what I’ve learned. The new idea I want to test gives me energy to keep pushing.
