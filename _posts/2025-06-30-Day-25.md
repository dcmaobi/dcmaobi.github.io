what_i_learned: |
  Today, being Monday, began with our usual team meeting with Dr. Oladunni. During the meeting, he asked each of us to share what we accomplished last week. It was helpful to hear everyone’s updates and see how our individual work connects to the bigger goals of the project. He also gave us corrections and feedback on our briefings, pointing out areas we could improve and clarifying his expectations for the week ahead. After the meeting, I continued working on the new code I started on Friday. I’m currently at the stage where I need to find ways to improve the model’s training accuracy. It’s been challenging so far, and the results aren’t where I want them to be yet. However, I’m staying optimistic and determined to keep testing different approaches until I figure out what works best. Overall, today felt like a focused start to the week, with clear goals and a mindset to keep pushing forward despite the difficulties.

blockers: |
  My major blocker today is the low accuracy of my model training. Despite trying different approaches and adjusting parts of the code, the accuracy is still not improving as much as I hoped. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m putting in a lot of effort without seeing clear results yet. I know I need to keep testing and maybe look into other techniques or preprocessing steps to help the model learn better. This has been slowing down my progress, but I’m determined to keep working on it until I find a solution.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me of the importance of staying patient and open to feedback. Sharing my progress with Dr. Oladunni and hearing his corrections helped me see where I can improve and what I should focus on this week. Even though working on improving the model’s accuracy has been tough and the results aren’t great yet, I feel motivated to keep trying different methods until I find something that works. It was a challenging start to the week, but I’m grateful for the guidance and I’m determined to keep moving forward.
